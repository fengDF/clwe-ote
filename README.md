## Abstract
> Fine-grained sentiment analysis is receiving increasing attention in recent
years. Extracting opinion target expressions (OTE) in reviews is often an important
step in fine-grained, aspect-based sentiment analysis. Retrieving this information from user-generated text, however, can be
difficult. Customer reviews, for instance, are prone to contain misspelled words and are
difficult to process due to their domain-specific language.
> In this work, we investigate whether character-level models can improve the
performance for the identification of opinion target expressions. We integrate information about the character structure of a word into a
sequence labeling system using character-level word embeddings and show their positive impact on the system's performance. Specifically, we obtain an increase by 3.3 points F1-score with respect to our
baseline model. In further experiments, we reveal encoded character patterns of the learned embeddings and give a nuanced view of the performance differences of both models.
